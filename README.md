## Overview ##
Black Duck plugin for Atlassian JIRA.  This plugin provides the ability to create JIRA issues based on vulnerabilities and Policy violations in Black Duck, and close them based on violation overrides.  Tickets will only be created for Black Duck projects that are mapped to JIRA projects and only for the violations that are selected.
